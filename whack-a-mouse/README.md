# WhackAMouse
Game made with C#, using Windows Forms in Visual Studio.

It was my first game ever made and it was a school project about object oriented programming.
This was made more than a year ago, my current knowlegde is much better, but I decided not to improve anything and just post the original version.
Try to beat highscore and have a nice day! :)
